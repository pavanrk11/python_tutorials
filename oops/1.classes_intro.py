# Namespace is a mapping from names to objects
# module1.func1() is different from module2.func1()

# Scope is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is "directly accessible"

1. The innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names
2. The scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest 
enclosing scope, contain non-local, but also non-global names
3. The next-to-last scope contains the current moduleâ€™s global names
4. The outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names

# Python OOPS

# Class: A blueprint for creating objects.
# Object: An instance of a class. Has a state and behavior associated with it(Identity->Uniqueness, State->property, Behavior)

# Attributes: Characteristics of an object.
# Methods: Functions that operate on the object's data.

# Inheritance: Mechanism for creating a new class from an existing class.

# Polymorphism: Ability to define methods in a child class that have the
# same name as the methods in the parent class but behave differently.

# Encapsulation: Bundling of data and methods. Attribute visibility, name mangling, properties

# Abstraction:
