# Composite pattern

# The problem is has a tree structure
# Examples: File System, Delivery Box, Organizational Hierarchy

# Component Interface: Base interface for all the objects in the composition.
# Leaf: It should be either an interface or an abstract class with the common methods to manage the child composites.
# Composite: Acts as a container that can hold both Leaf and other Composite instances, forming the structure.
# client: Has access to the composition elements by using the base component object.
